# OpenTable x Priceline.com

Preface...this entire test took a lot of time to implement, from the get go.

At the time, the group-level board laid a challenge to us to be faster to market than Booking.com with an OpenTable cross-sell. The idea was going to be to lead with some fixed markets and build around those, which is what we did. Phase 1 was all hardcoded, phase 2 is all dynamic. Phase 1 design went fast...it was just the dev work that was a killer.

In phase 1.2, since we weren't seeing high click results (revealed to not be our problem) we decided to also add in the ability to download their app from the email. This just added another layer of complexity but was simple to execute.

Time-wise, this was a longer project just because we were collaborating with a special projects team at a sister company, which at the time was not a common thing amongst the Priceline Group companies. This meant that we had to wait on decisions on a different schedule than we were used to...and also discovery of information was at a different pace as well.

At the time I left the project, the cross-sell was seeing very good conversion in the markets that we had tested. Conversion, in this case, was defined as customers clicking out of the inbox to download the OpenTable app, then register, then make a booking/reservation within 30 days of the travel dates.
