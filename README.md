## Works
This repo is a collection of projects that I have compiled into a portfolio. It's a temporary solution while I build out a Vue app.

Please use the directory below to see projects that I've completed and contributed to through my time at HubSpot, Klaviyo, Order, priceline.com, Tentrr, and any freelance or random projects I have kicking around. There are also (hopefully) a couple of smaller more OSS-type projects that will be listed here as well. I want to give back to the design community since it has been a huge part of my continued growth in this field, so I try to commit and comment where I feel it is right. As long as we have design discussions, we will keep creating new design solutions.

### Side projects / fun things
#### MunchMadness @ Tentrr
We had an annual tradition of picking 16-32 dumpling houses/offerings up against eachother in a March Madness-style bracket. It was in the name of having fun and doing some team building (also eating a lot of really good dumplings), but also to put some free social content up for local Chinatown businesses that we picked.
